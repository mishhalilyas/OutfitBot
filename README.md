### Project Description
OutfitBot is a revolutionary AI-powered fashion assistant designed to meticulously analyze your wardrobe and suggest the most spectacularly inappropriate outfit for any occasion. It ensures you'll never fit in again, freeing you from the tyranny of good taste.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The modern world is plagued by 'decision fatigue,' especially when choosing an outfit. The constant pressure to look 'put-together' for social events, dates, or even a trip to the grocery store is overwhelming. What if you could reclaim your mental energy by actively choosing to look... certifiably awful?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
OutfitBot is our groundbreaking answer. Using a sophisticated algorithm, it scans your clothing items and generates outfit combinations with the highest possible 'Mismatch Score'. It cross-references event types (e.g., 'Wedding,' 'Job Interview,' 'Funeral') with a database of social faux pas to recommend outfits that guarantee you'll be the center of bewildered attention. Finally, freedom from the shackles of convention!
